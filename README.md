saltybit
========

This is a fork of Euank's saltybit project [saltybit](https://github.com/euank/saltybit)

Expands upon the fight record idea and also includes a recommendation feature and some aggregate statistics

TODO
========
websocket server to allow client-accessible recommendations + maybe control
private auth so as to avoid the public statistics rule in the [SaltyBet FAQ](http://www.saltybet.com/about)
